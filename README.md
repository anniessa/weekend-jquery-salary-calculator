## Description

_Duration: 1 weekend_

This application is salary calculator was a weekend project during Prime Digital Academy using jQuery and JavaScript.

The application has an form that collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.

A 'Submit' button collects the form information, stores the information to calculate monthly costs, appends information to the DOM and clears the input fields. Using the stored information, we can calculate monthly costs and append this to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, total monthly cost turns red.

A delete button removes an employee from the DOM.
